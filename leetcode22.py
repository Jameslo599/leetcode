# Is Palindrome

# Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.

# A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

# Output: true
# Explanation: After considering only alphanumerical characters we have "wasitacaroracatisaw", which is a palindrome.

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "tab a cat"

# Output: false
# Explanation: "tabacat" is not a palindrome.

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
# s is made up of only printable ASCII characters.

        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1
        while left < right:
            while not s[left].isalnum() and left < right: left+=1
            while not s[right].isalnum() and right > left: right-=1
            if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower(): return False
            left+=1
            right-=1
        return True
